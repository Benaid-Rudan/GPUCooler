# Project Description
This project was developed as a seminar assignment for the Embedded and Real-Time Systems course. The aim of the project is to develop a system that measures the temperature of a graphics card and automatically controls the fan speed for cooling purposes. The project was implemented using STM32 CubeMX for microcontroller configuration, Keil uVision for code development and compilation, and Proteus Pro for simulation.

# Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, follow these steps:

Download the project_proteus.prj file containing the Proteus project configuration.
Open Proteus Pro and load the project_proteus.prj file.
Load the HEX file generated from Keil uVision onto the STM32 microcontroller in Proteus.
Start the simulation.

# Project Features
Temperature Measurement: The system uses a temperature sensor to periodically measure the temperature of the graphics card.
Automatic Cooling: Based on the measured temperature values, the system automatically controls the fan speed to maintain the temperature within safe limits.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): A simple graphical display of temperature.

# Technologies Used
STM32 CubeMX: Used for STM32 microcontroller configuration.
Keil uVision: Used for code development, compilation, and HEX file generation.
Proteus Pro: Used for simulating the entire system.
